//1 A car's gas mileage is calculated by taking a car's initial odometer reading at some point and taking a final reading at a later point in time, then dividing the difference by the number of gallons of gasoline used. Write a function that can calculate the gas mileage for a 12 gallon test, if the car starts at 10,000 miles and ends at any number.

//4 final odometer reading (x var) - (10,000) inital odometer reading = odometerDifference

//5 gallons = 12

//6 odometerDifference / 12 (# of gallons)

//7 x = ((final odometer reading - initial odometer reading) / # of gallons)
  
//8 x = (( " + 10,000) - 10,000) / 12))



  //x = ((finalOdometer - initialOdometer) / gallons)

  function mileage(finalOdometer, initalOdometer, gallons) {
  
  var finalOdometer = prompt("You're going on a road trip and your car already has 10,000 miles on it. How many miles are on your car by the end of your trip?");

  var initialOdometer = 10000;
  
  var gallons = 12;
  
  var result = ((finalOdometer - initialOdometer) / gallons);
  
  console.log(result);
  
  }

mileage();
